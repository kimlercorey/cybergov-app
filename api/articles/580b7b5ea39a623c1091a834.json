    "brief": "<p>Best practices bring policy compliance, but policy compliance does not always deliver best practices. We will reduce our cyber risk exposure by implementing cybersecurity best practices across all our activities, from training to daily operations. We identify areas of government-wide strength and weaknesses through our intensive engagement with Federal agencies, and through our efforts to track the right metrics and drive the right behaviors in reporting. We identify common challenges and share what we have learned has worked well amongst Federal agencies so that together we can present a united front in strengthening our collective security. We will foster an environment where our people have the right resources and training to do the right things the right way to achieve our goal. We will keep our people and systems current with the latest training, system patches, and architectures. We will continuously test and audit the effectiveness of our processes, technical activities, and training. We will engage with agencies on their understanding of threats, and the response to incidents, and leverage specialized teams to hunt for unauthorized activities on our networks.</p>",
