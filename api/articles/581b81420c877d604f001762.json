Today&rsquo;s environment calls for informed decisions to be made at the right level based on a clearly articulated risk management construct. We will ensure that agencies clearly outline incident response roles and responsibilities for their personnel during a cybersecurity incident, so that issues are brought to the attention of both executive and cybersecurity management in a timely manner. We will continue to measure progress through targeted metrics that provide visibility into risk exposure and drive decisions, and ensure that cyber risk management is integrated into planning, programming, and budgetary activities across the government.</p>","extended":""},"url":"","author":{"$oid":"57ffa09e912367363e03a5b5"},"publishedDate":{"$date":"2016-11-03T00:00:00.000-0700"}}
