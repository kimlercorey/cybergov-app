We will foster a culture where innovation in funding models, service delivery models, processes, and technology is encouraged and rewarded. We will promote investment approaches for new processes and technology that align mission and risk management. We will prioritize spending in the development of more secure and efficient technology solutions over maintaining legacy IT. We will establish new approaches to cybersecurity service delivery, including a centralized IT network. We will develop methods for modernizing the authorization processes for services, including automating testing of security controls, and facilitate efforts to rapidly deploy emerging technologies throughout the government. We will measure our progress through value-added metrics that demonstrate return on investment, risk measures, and productivity.</p>","extended":""},"sortOrder":17,"url":"","publishedDate":{"$date":"2016-11-03T00:00:00.000-0700"}}
